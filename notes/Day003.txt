- WM_CLOSE -> PostQuitMessage(0)
- Don't give a shit about releasing windows and other resources at the end of the program. 
  It is faster to just quit when the user wants to quit. 
  Windows will clean up the mess anyway and do it much faster.
- to help make the difference between in-function static and global static, and non-extern functions
#define internal static
#define local_persist static
#define global_variable static
- while(running) instead of for(;;), and running = false on WM_CLOSe and WM_DESTROY
- name Win32XXXX your functions that can collide with windows functions.
